# 2-Portfolio

## Description
This is my Portfolio page, and the first web page I have written soup-to-nuts in my life. I am very excited about it. 

In its current state is has not actual content to link to. But over time I will add to it and style it to make it more of my own.

I learned so much writing this simple little page. I learned how to utilize flexbox to organize content. I also learned how to apply different content styles and structure based on the size of the viewbox with a media query. I also learned that tasks like this are not too big for me.
